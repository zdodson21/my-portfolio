  <p slot="col-1" style="text-align: left">My name is Zach Dodson. I am a Penn State University student with intent to graduate in December 2024 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Enterprise Technology Integration. I have experience
    in front-end web development, writing, and teaching individuals.
    I have interest in continuing my career in front-end development, educating others how to use various technologies, and technical writing to help others better understand the tools they are utilizing.</p><p slot="col-1" style="text-align: left"><a href="https://my-links-zach.vercel.app/" target="_blank" role="textbox">Click here to see my links</a><br>

<p style="text-align: left">I &#8203;have &#8203;long &#8203;held &#8203;the &#8203;belief &#8203;that &#8203;knowledge and experience is best gained by doing, not just by listening such as in a lecture. The majority of skills and experience listed in this portfolio has been gained through practical means such as building projects and helping others learn.<br></p>
