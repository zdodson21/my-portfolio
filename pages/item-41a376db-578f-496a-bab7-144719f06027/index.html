<p data-text-align="justify"><a href="https://wynncraft.com/" target="_blank" role="textbox">Wynncraft</a> &#8203;is &#8203;a &#8203;Minecraft &#8203;server that creates an MMORPG experience within Minecraft, with a custom texture pack, soundtrack, quests, and more. Unfortunately, due to it being a free-to-play Minecraft server, there was never a chance for it to receive a standalone physical edition, similar to a game such as World of Warcraft, which released on numerous CDs for Windows &#38; Macintosh systems at the time of it's release. Another benefit of physical media that Wynncraft lacks is the extra "goodies" that come in the package, such as guides, maps, and more.<br></p>
<p data-text-align="justify">The goal of this project was to create what I imagined a physical release collection of Wynncraft would look like along with it's updates (in the case of this project they were thought of as "expansion packs". This includes creating DVD slip covers, CD labels, and numerous extras to be inserted into each DVD case. The following images showcase the numerous designs created to make this project come to life.&#8203;</p>
<p data-text-align="justify"><i>Note: ​This ​project ​is ​not officially ​affiliated with Wynncraft in anyway. This is just a fun fan project used as incentive to learn various graphic design techniques and softwares such as <b>GIMP</b> (for graphic design), <b>Aseprite</b> (for creating numerous original sprites and recreating existing sprites), and <b>LibreOffice Draw</b> for ensuring proper page layout for printing.</i></p>
