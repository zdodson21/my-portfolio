These &#8203;web &#8203;components &#8203;were &#8203;utilized &#8203;to &#8203;create &#8203;one &#8203;big &#8203;component, &#8203;named &#8203;<code target="_blank">chat-agent</code>. &#8203;The goal &#8203;of &#8203;this &#8203;project &#8203;was &#8203;to &#8203;create &#8203;a &#8203;chat &#8203;agent &#8203;for &#8203;websites &#8203;created &#8203;with &#8203;HAXcms that &#8203;could essentially act &#8203;as a &#8203;virtual &#8203;teacher, &#8203;using &#8203;website &#8203;content &#8203;and &#8203;HAX &#8203;knowledge &#8203;(for &#8203;developers) as context &#8203;to &#8203;answer &#8203;user &#8203;questions. &#8203;Under the hood, a "store" is used to house anything that is needed across the various sub-components of the overhead <code>chat-agent</code> component. This includes global variables and functions. The code for this store can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/webcomponents/blob/master/elements/chat-agent/lib/chat-agent-store.js" role="textbox" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    the scanner is mapped back onto the mesh to add color, markings, and other details.
